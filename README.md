# 🛍 Retail Sales Database — Design & Analytics

This project focuses on converting an Amazon retail sales dataset into a **normalized relational database** and performing **analytical SQL queries** to uncover business insights.

---

## Project Objectives

- Convert cleaned retail dataset into a **relational database schema**
- Normalize data into **3rd Normal Form (3NF)**
- Execute analytical SQL queries for sales insights
- Generate ER diagram & supporting visuals

## Database Design (3NF)

Normalized tables created:
- **Customers**
- **Products**
- **Orders**
- **OrderDetails**

Ensures:
✔ No duplicate customer/product details  
✔ Referential integrity enforced via **Primary/Foreign Keys**  
✔ Scalable & efficient analytical querying

## ER Diagram

> Full ERD available in `ER Diagram.png`


![ER Diagram](ER Diagram.png)


Tables & relationships:
```

Customers 1 ────∞ Orders 1 ────∞ OrderDetails ∞──── 1 Products

```

---

## Analytical SQL Queries

✔ Top-selling product by month  
✔ Sales by region using JOIN + GROUP BY  
✔ Customers with total spend > threshold using HAVING clause  
 

## Query Results

### Top Selling Products

## Tools & Technologies Used

| Component | Technology |
|----------|------------|
| Database | SQLite |
| Querying | SQL |
| Processing | Python + Pandas |
| Visualization | Built-in Jupyter screenshot capture |

## Key Insights

- Product sales volumes peak in specific months for top categories
- Maharashtra & Karnataka lead in total order revenue
- High-value repeat customers generate majority of profit

These insights can support targeted promotions and stock planning.
